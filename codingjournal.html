<h1>Miller's Coding Journal</h1>
<h2>10-22-19</h2>
<p>Today I'm making my journal! I had a problem at first figuring out how to make the journal itself, but now I think it's working. I just tested it and it worked! Success!</p>

<h2>10-28-19</h2>
<p>Today I made thef first part of what will eventually become a piano. I opened by makey makey and figured out how to connect it to my computer. Then I pulled up the site containing the piano code so that I could make it work with the piano. I connected the makey makey to the keys of my computer when I then in turn connected to pieces of foil to use as the 'keys' of my piano. While trying to 'play' this so called piano, I had to hold onto another piece of tin foil that was connected to the ground of the makey makey. That when whenever I pressed a key the circuit was completed and there was power going to the makey makey. It wasn't a very hard process, but each element took a lot of time because I had never done it before. It was really rewarding to see the whole thing come to fruition!</p>
