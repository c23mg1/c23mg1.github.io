<h1>Miller's Coding Journal</h1>
<h2>10-22-19</h2>
<p>Today I'm making my journal! I had a problem at first figuring out how to make the journal itself, but now I think it's working. I just tested it and it worked! Success!</p>

<h2>10-28-19</h2>
<p>Today I made thef first part of what will eventually become a piano. I opened by makey makey and figured out how to connect it to my computer. Then I pulled up the site containing the piano code so that I could make it work with the piano. I connected the makey makey to the keys of my computer when I then in turn connected to pieces of foil to use as the 'keys' of my piano. While trying to 'play' this so called piano, I had to hold onto another piece of tin foil that was connected to the ground of the makey makey. That when whenever I pressed a key the circuit was completed and there was power going to the makey makey. It wasn't a very hard process, but each element took a lot of time because I had never done it before. It was really rewarding to see the whole thing come to fruition!</p>

<h2>11-11-19</h2>
<p>Today I worked on creating a code for a piano in scratch. I was planning to use the makeymakey website code, and when I found that couldn't work I decided to make my own piano code in scratch that I could eventually turn into HTML. I didn't really face any difficulty in making the code- the only potential issue is that there is a little lag in how quickly the user can play the keys in sequence. Overall it was a very smooth process, though and I am optimistic about what it will mean for the future! </p>

<h2>11-15-19</h2>
<p>Today I worked on an assignment given to us called FizzBuzz. In essence the project wanted us to create a code with a counter that climbed 1 each time, and when the number was a multiple of three, Fizz would be displayed, when it was a multiple of 5, Buzz would be displayed, and when it was a multiple of 15, FizzBuzz would be displayed. I made it in scratch and it ultimately didn't take me that long, and I just used what I knew about how division works to make the code understand when there was no remainder of the number when divided by 3, 5, or 15, it would say the corresponding word.</p>

<p>Today I worked on creating my function sketch. It is just a simply calculator, but it took me a long time to make. I thought this to be very funny because I already had a code that was a calculator, but I challenged myself not to copy it because if I did then I wouldn't really understand how it worked. Using what I knew and some info from w3, I was able to get it to work!! It is not very colorful or interesting, but it works, and I was happy with that after the multiple hours it took me to get it to work... Anyway- here it is:

<p>Today I read the JavaScript for Cats informative website/blog/thing, and I thought it was really helpful. While I didn't understand some of it, what I did understand was phrased clearly and helped me to understand how and why certain things in JavaScript work. I also likes that it was a little humorous because otherwise it would have been a little dry, but the way it was written kept it interesting, and I thought the piece overall to be very worth reading. It helped me to overall grasp the way JavaScript works and also what it was created for. Overall üëç</p>


<h2>12-12-19</h2>
<p>It's been a while since I have posted. Since then I have worked really hard on my piano code in JavaScript. I've added keys and it plays the sounds I want it to when the user clicks on the letter corresponding to the note. Now I am working on getting the code to work so that if a key on the keyboard is pressed, it makes the notes play, rather than clicking on them. That will be the last step in making the code compatable with the MakeyMakey. Today I worked on my array code which is a random soccer player generator. I only have three players so far, and the code doesn't work. I should make a lab with Molly to go over it an make it work. I have spent over an hour on it and it still won't work- I ckecked it online and checked Molly's code for her egg generator, and debugged it myself and nothing really worked. I am probably missing something obvious but idk what it is... My function and my FizzBuzz code are working, but I have to check on the link for FizzBuzz because when I am not logged into scratch it isn't working and I want to make sure that it works for any user and not just for me.

Thanks for reading. Ik this was a long one but I had a lot to update on.

<h2>2-3-20</h2>
<p>Yet again it's been a while since I've posted. Since my last post we had winter break and then there were some really sad events at school so we haven't had many normal classes at all since then. I haven't done that much coding since then, and I need to think more about what I would like to work on the in the second semester. I could work on my piano stairs, but I think in some ways I'm too close to work on that for a semester and in some ways I'm way too far from being done... I'll figure it out. I have worked on one project with Spencer which was our randomly moving and sized pictures of Diego Schwartzman. We couldn't figure out how to make a button to make all of them disappear, but we were able to get the pictures to be randomly sized and move whenever the page was reloaded. It uses a random math function to make all of their sizes and locations random. The user does have to reload the page to get them to change, but we are working on making it better. Also- for a little context- Diego Schwartzman is a 5' 6" Argentinian tennis player and we both really like him. I'm looking forward to working on something really cool this semester! I just can't figure out what it is. Whenever I figure it out, it's going right here! I still need to make more of my links on my normal page sneakers, but I'll do that when I have more time and I'm not focused on figuring out a project to do...
